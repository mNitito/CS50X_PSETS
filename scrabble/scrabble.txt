// if user prints string which it is value > the value of the other string

    compute the value of the string by assigned the value of each latter
    // UPPER CASE AND LOWER CASE ARE THE SAME
    //REJECT THE UN LETTER CHARCTER
}
// in main we put the condition
// in MAIN WE PRINTF("THE WINNER")


// THE SOLUTION

// WE NEED TO INCREASE THE SCORE BY PIONTS[// the (index) that assigned to the alphabet of the word[i]]
// for example POINTS[25] EQUAL TO 10 which is assigned to the letter z .. thus if the word[i] equal to z -
// then we want to add scoer to the POINTS[25]; .. FOR EX IF word[i] equal z .. which is z eqaul to 122 in ascii table -
// we want the assignedd value of z in scrabble game .. 25 = 122 - x .. thus x == 97 which equal to a -
// if word[i] = Z .. which is equal to 90 thus 25 = 90 - x .. thus x= 65 which  eQual to A THUS scoer of z in scraable game -
// equal to POINTS[Z - A]; this thiing implment also in the rest of charcters thus isupper(word[i]) thus POINTS[word[i] - A];

for (int i = 0; i < strlen(word); i++)
    {
        if (islower(word[i]))
        {
            printf(" the value of the  char: %i \n", word[i]);
             score = score + POINTS[word[i] - a];
        }
        else if (isupper(word[i]))
        {
            score = score + POINTS[word[i] - A];
        }
        else if (word[i] < 65 ||  word[i] > 122)
        {
            score = score + 0;
        }
    }

// update: no need to assign this values and it also didn't workkk
